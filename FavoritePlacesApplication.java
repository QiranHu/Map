 * One instance of the Application class is created when the app is launched and persists
 * throughout its lifetime.
 * This is unlike activities, which are created and destroyed as the user navigates to different
 * screens in the app.
 * As a result, the Application class can be a good place to store constants and initialize things
 * that are potentially needed by multiple activities, such as our places API client.
 *
 * You may need to change the code in this file, but probably not that much.
